#BUGS -
      - **fixed added logic in user controller** username and token are    undefined in localStorage
      - creating a username does not tell you username is already taken
      - hard refresh on individual marker makes the marker disappear
      - only show one info window at a time 


#Styling
  - Do Subheading of like "find and share street art in your local community"


### Remove tag feature


### refactor
  - Use own props in the map state to props to find the particular photo
  - return it as a prop
  - try to change all the prop passing for the map

### find marker by id
  - maps/id if they click on one
  - Render marker based on what they clicked on
  - setup a marker in store
  - if they click on it from the show page add marker to store
  - check assign variable in map to store or to all
  - center map based on marker
  - find a way to clear state after leaving the page
  -

  "fixed bug on link in infowindow didn't go to the right show page url"
